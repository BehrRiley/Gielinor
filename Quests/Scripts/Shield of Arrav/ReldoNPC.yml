  d3: "Ah, yes. I know. If you look in a book called 'The Shield of Arrav', you'll find a quest in there. I'm not sure  where    the book is mind you... but I'm sure it's around here somewhere."
  d4: "Oh. But you said you're in search of a quest."
  d5: "You perplex me. Well, come back if you change your mind again."
  d6: "No, I don't. I think I know someone who might however. If I were you I would talk to Baraek, the fur trader in the market place. I've heard he has connections with the Phoenix Gang."
  d7: "Only knowledge."
  d8: "No, sorry, that was just my little joke. I'm not the trading type."
  d9: "Until next time."
  d10: "I am the palace librarian."
  d11: "Yes. Although i would probably be in here even if i didn't work here. I like reading. Someday i hope to catalogue all of the information stored in these books so all may read it."

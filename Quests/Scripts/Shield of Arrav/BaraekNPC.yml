  d1: "Hello there."
  d2: "Sh sh sh, not so loud! You don't want to get me in trouble!"
  d3: "I may do. But I don't want to get into trouble for revealing their hideout. Of course, if I was, say 100 gold coins richer I may happen to be more inclined to take that sort of risk..."
  d4: "What? I thought you were meant to bribe me, not the other way around... oh, forget it!"
  d5: "In that case I wouldn't dare tell you anything about the Phoenix Gang."
  d6: "Ok, to get to the gang hideout, enter Varrock through the south gate. Then, if you take the first turning east, somewhere along there is an alleyway to the south. The door at the end of there is the entrance to the Phoenix Gang. They're operating there under the name of the VTAM Corporation. Be careful. The Phoenixes ain't the types to be messed about."
  d7: "Hey now ... the Phoenix Gang make it their business to not be easy to find. Look, if you get lost, talk to Charlie the tramp near the Varrock south gate. He can give you better directions."
  d8: "Heh. If you wanna deal with the Phoenix Gang they're involved in much worse than a bit of bribery."
  d9: "Yeah, sure. They're 100 gold coins each."
  d10: "Well, I can't go any cheaper than that mate. I have a family to feed."
  d11: "Sorry kiddo, I'm a fur trader not a damsel in distress.

# Quests
Quests are groups of interrelated tasks, usually involving a story line, that can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours or even a few days to complete.

This is going to be a very extended effort put into for storylines and etc, the quest series will be based on a **choose your own adventure**. Quite literally, some quest objective NPC's can be "killed" and you won't ever be able to talk to them again; You can choose *Not* to do whatever you don't feel like doing. You can *choose* not to agree with your mission, and do something totally different, so long as the job get's finished or sabotaged somehow.  Special areas, NPC's, relationships & actions will be capable with different paths & choices you make, and they can affect the outcome of your story, make being in areas & doing different things harder or easier, etc etc.

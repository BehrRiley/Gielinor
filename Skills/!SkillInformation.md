## Skill Descriptions

### Melee Skills
Using melee weapons *(ie swords/axes/etc)*, `shift+right-clicking` will open the interface to select your `<combat style>`. This will be consistent and does not require repetitive configuration, but it is an interesting feature to note because of their passive benefits:
  
**Combat Styles**: Accurate *(atk)*  | Aggressive *(str)*  |  Defensive *(def)*  |  Controlled *(atk/def/str)*
  
**Attack**: Allows players to wield stronger melee weapons and fight more accurately in Melee.
**Strength**: Allows players to deal more melee damage and equip certain weapons. It also gives access to several agility shortcuts.
**Defense**: Allows players to wear stronger armour and decrease chance of being hit.
**Hitpoints**: This is passively leveled as you deal damage to enemies.

Experience gained for melee skills are based on hit-points dealt.

### Ranged Skill
Using ranged weapons (ie bows, crossbows when 1.14 comes out) `shift+right-clicking` will open the interface to select your `<combat style>`. This is similar to Melee, however have their own mechanical differences:
**Combat Styles**: Accurate  |  Rapid  |  Special  |  Defensive
**Accurate**: Charging the bow normally allows you to shoot quicker arrows for a more accurate shot.
**Rapid**: This will be similar to normal minecraft mechanics.
**Defensive**: Defensive firing will be slower, yet more defensive against enemies using ranged. Your experience will split between ranged and defensive, as well as you gain defensive bonuses using this.
**Special**: This is going to be for ability based firing, similar to "Serrated Strikes" with McMMO. Special abilities will be toggle-able skills earned with higher ranged levels (ie; explosive arrows, multi-shots, poison/enchanted arrows, etc)

*Ranged attacks require arrows/ammunition, and you gain `<Ranged>` experiece based on the amount of hit-points dealt.

### Magic Skill
Using magical weapons (ie staffs, wands) `shift+right-clicking` will open the interface to select your **<combat style>**. This is a very unique ranged ability, which lets you cast spells that can be equip through your spellbook(s). Mechanics are very unique, and you actually are required to *learn how to use them before you can access them* fully at the Wizard Training Arena.

**Combat Styles**: Accurate  |  Rapid  |  Defensive

**Accurate**: Cast spells more accurately.
**Rapid>*: Spells can be fired quicker, bear in mind your computers performance capability with particles, with a lesser accurate firing rate.
**Defensive**: A normal firing rate similar to accurate, however an increased accuracy is substituted with a defensive bonus instead, making you harder to hit.

*Magic spells require runes to cast, and you gain experience in `<Magic>` on a base-experience-chart for the spell, as well as additional experience for every hit-point you deal.

## Support Skills
### Agility
Experienced gained by taking fall damage, performing agile abilities, using agility courses, tracks and shortcuts. Agility will increase player speed at a minuscule rate, reduce fall damage and give a chance to negate fall damage completely with a roll effect.

### Thieving
Allows players to steal from market stalls and chests and pickpocket NPC's by sneaking and right-clicking them.

### Slayer
Slayer Master NPC's will assign special monsters as tasks, which players can seek out and kill a number based on task of the enemy in the location for Slayer Experience. Higher slayer is required for more vicious and skillful enemies.

## Gathering Skills
### Mining
Experience gained by mining and excavating. Power-Mining ability will be activated shift-right clicking to increase mining speed temporarily.

### Fishing
Fish for fish and for junk. New fish types to come with this skill; larger fish can be found in different locations which will heal more health and give more experience. **dangerous encounters can include finding a variety of dangerous items while fishing**, which decrease in chance with level increases.

### Woodcutting
Experience gained by cutting wood; abilities include a tree-feller type ability, allowing you to chop entire trees at once. This will be different from McMMO in the sense that you will be able to do this so many times within a time period based on level, opposed to a time period you're given to rush and chop as many as you can within a time period.

### Hunter
Experience gained by killing passive mobs and animals. Higher levels increase passive mob drops like leather.

### Farming
Experience gained by planting crops and harvesting crops. Passive abilities include automatic-replanting after harvesting, as well as increased crop-rates. A special spellbook will allow you to utilize magic to plant crops faster as well as harvesting.

## Artisan Skills
### Cooking
Experience gained by cooking food. Food will actually burn now, and this chance decreases with level increase. Larger food items will require higher cooking levels for successful cooking.

### Smithing
Experience gained by repairing armor and creating armor specifically. Higher levels decrease the amount of material required to repair armor as well as increase the amount of durability that is repaired with material.

### Firemaking
This skill is tied to TNT directly, allowing higher levels to time their detonations, as well as create custom items to utilize TNT efficiently. This will include TNT arrows to be used as a special ability with the `<Ranged>` skill, hand-tossing TNT, various other abilities.

A note on this skill, Grief Prevention is receiving a very big change, which will create great opportunities for this skill.

### Herblore
Experienced gained by making potions and components for potions.

### Crafting
Experience gained by creating items in the crafting menu.

### Runecrafting
Runecrafting is a skill that allows players to craft their own runes for Magic spells. Runes are crafted from either rune essence, pure essence, or dark essence, and are converted at obelisks and altars in unique locations.

### Construction
Experienced gained by building blocks

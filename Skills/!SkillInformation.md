## Skill Descriptions

### Melee Skills

Using melee weapons *(ie swords/axes/etc)*, `shift+right-clicking` will open the interface to select your `<combat style>`. This will be consistent and does not require repetitive configuration, but it is an interesting feature to note because of their passive benefits:
  
**Combat Styles**: Accurate *(atk)*  | Aggressive *(str)*  |  Defensive *(def)*  |  Controlled *(atk/def/str)*
  
**Attack**: Allows players to wield stronger melee weapons and fight more accurately in Melee.
**Strength**: Allows players to deal more melee damage and equip certain weapons. It also gives access to several agility shortcuts.
**Defense**: Allows players to wear stronger armour and decrease chance of being hit.
**Hitpoints**: This is passively leveled as you deal damage to enemies.

Experience gained for melee skills are based on hit-points dealt.

### Ranged Skill

Using ranged weapons (ie bows, crossbows when 1.14 comes out) `shift+right-clicking` will open the interface to select your `<combat style>`. This is similar to Melee, however have their own mechanical differences:
**Combat Styles**: Accurate  |  Rapid  |  Special  |  Defensive
**Accurate**: Charging the bow normally allows you to shoot quicker arrows for a more accurate shot.
**Rapid**: This will be similar to normal minecraft mechanics.
**Defensive**: Defensive firing will be slower, yet more defensive against enemies using ranged. Your experience will split between ranged and defensive, as well as you gain defensive bonuses using this.
**Special**: This is going to be for ability based firing, similar to "Serrated Strikes" with McMMO. Special abilities will be toggle-able skills earned with higher ranged levels (ie; explosive arrows, multi-shots, poison/enchanted arrows, etc)

*Ranged attacks require arrows/ammunition, and you gain `<Ranged>` experiece based on the amount of hit-points dealt.

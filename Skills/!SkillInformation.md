## Skill Descriptions

### Melee Skills

Using melee weapons (ie swords/axes/etc), shift+right clicking will open the interface to select your <combat style>. This will be consistent and does not require repetitive configuration, but it is an interesting feature to note because of their passive benefits:
  
**<Combat Styles>**: Accurate (atk)  | Aggressive (str)  |  Defensive (def)  |  Controlled (all)
  
**<Attack>**: Allows players to wield stronger melee weapons and fight more accurately in Melee.
**<Strength>**: Allows players to deal more melee damage and equip certain weapons. It also gives access to several agility shortcuts.
**<Defense>**: Allows players to wear stronger armour and decrease chance of being hit.
**<Hitpoints>**: This is passively leveled as you deal damage to enemies.

Experience gained for melee skills are based on hit-points dealt.

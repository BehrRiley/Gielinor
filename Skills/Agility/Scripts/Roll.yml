# ██   Passive Skill | Roll
# ██   
# ██   Rolling is a passive skill which allows the player to reduce fall damage.
# ██   Every level, the chance for a successful roll increases by 0.5%,
# ██   with a maximum chance of 50% at level 99. As rolling is a passive skill, 
# ██   it will be activated simply by taking fall damage. When activated,
# ██   it can negate up to 7 hitpoints, or 3.5 hearts.

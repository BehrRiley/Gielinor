# Agility
Agility is a skill that allows negation of fall damage through passive and active skills, Roll and Graceful Roll, as well as combat damage negation with the passive skill "Dodge". Higher Agility level allows for faster run speeds. At level 10 Agility, a player's speed is increased by 1%. At level 50 Agility, a player's speed is increased by 5%.


## Active Abilities

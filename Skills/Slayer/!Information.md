#Slayer
Slayer Master NPC's will assign special monsters that may otherwise be immune to damage as tasks, which players can seek out and kill a number based on task of the enemy in the location for Slayer Experience. Higher slayer is required for more vicious and skillful enemies. Slayer is a very profitable skill to train, as high levelled slayer monsters such as slayer bosses have a multitude of both rare and valuable drops.

To receive a Slayer task, players must visit one of seven Slayer masters throughout the map. All but two Slayer masters have a Combat level requirement, and the final Slayer master also has a Slayer level requirement. The tasks assigned are generally appropriate for the Combat level of the player, assuming he or she uses the highest level master available. Players may be assigned normal monsters to kill, or they may be assigned monsters that require the use of Slayer-specific items to deal damage or Slayer-specific armour to prevent stat reduction.

# Thieving
Allows players to obtain coins and items by stealing from market stalls, chests, or by pickpocketing non-player characters. This skill also allows players to unlock doors and disarm traps. 

## Active Abilities
### Pickpocketing
This is the act of walking up to an NPC and shift-right- clicking them. If successful, you will gain Thieving experience and possibly coins or various items. However, it is possible for the NPC to notice a pickpocket, in which case the NPC will yell "What do you think you're doing?" or some other surprised saying and stun you for four seconds, which will take off a couple of your Hitpoints. 

### Stalls
There are a large number of stalls throughout the map, although many of them are in the Ardougne Market. Unlike pickpocketing NPCs, stealing from stalls have a 100% success rate as long as you are not in the line of sight of the stall owner or any of the nearby guards. It should be noted you may not interact with or come close to the stall owner for up to 10 minutes (while logged in) after the last theft from his or her stall. Time spend logged out will not help remove the NPC interact restriction.

### Chests
There are chests scattered throughout the map. Some chests will have traps on them, to discover what lay inside of them, the trap must be disarmed using the Thieving skill by shift-right-clicking on the chest to allow your character to disarm the trap and obtain the items inside. After a player thieves from a chest, he will need to wait for a short period of time before he can again thieve from the chest. If you attempt to thieve from a chest with a trap, the player will attempt to open the chest and take damage, this damage scales off of your current health down to a minimum.

Once chests had dual traps: the initial trap disarmed by the Thieving skill, and a secondary trap that released Poison Gas into the air, so lower level players required caution.

### Doors
Certain doors in RuneScape can not be opened by players unless the lock is picked. In order to pick a lock, shift-right-click on a door to pick the lock. If the player has the required Thieving level, the door will then be opened. Some doors will require a lockpick to successfully pick the lock.

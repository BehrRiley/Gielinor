# Mining
Experience gained by mining and excavating. Power-Mining ability will be activated shift-right clicking to increase mining speed temporarily.

## Active Abilities
### Super Breaker
Power-Miner is activated by right-clicking with a pickaxe in hand, will temporarily add 5 enchantment levels to your pickaxe for a period of time (dependent on mining level). Example: If your pickaxe currently has Efficiency III, it will function as if it had Efficiency VIII.
The duration of the skill starts at 2 seconds, increases by 1 second every 5 levels, with a maximum duration of 22 seconds at level 99.
Cool down time is 240 seconds unaffected by level. This ability also allows you to triple the chance of getting double drops / replacing double drop chance with triple drop chance for the duration of super breaker.

## Passive Abilities
### Double Drops
Double drops is a passive skill that allows the player to gain two items instead of the usual one when mining any naturally generated block found in the experience table below. The odds of this happening increase by 0.1% per level to a maximum of 99% at level 99. It does not stack with the fortune enchantment, but does work with silk touch.

# Gielinor
Project Gielinor is going to be our primary Adventure Map. Players will play in adventure mode, and blocks won't be able to be naturally destroyed. Some aspects of block changing will be related to mining, farming,  digging and woodcutting. One example of these (they will become complicated, server-sided rather) is that Digging will only be done with a special Spade found within the adventure world, and  blocks will quickly regenerate to refrain from severe damages. This will be used for quests and treasure trails. 

This map is replicating an existing game Runescape, and a lot of the models are not done by us, but have open permissions to utilize. We're just expanding it since it's also dead from like three years ago. "Exact-Replicas" aren't entirely necessary, just nostalgic to those of us who played, and gives a realistic feel to the maps we have created that we'll be using (ie; the treasure-trail map showed in the Map Clue Scrolls section below). Complete accuracy isn't necessary either, certain features will not exist that do so in the other game.

Features that will be a part of the adventure experience:
- Adventure Mode
- Choose your own adventure story-lines & quests (very dynamic storylines)
- Puzzles & Challenges
- Custom game-events
- Custom Monsters
- Custom Equipment

Custom equipment will be able to return to the Overworld, however nothing else will be able to come to the Adventure Map. Inventories will be separated, so items will stay in the players' inventories for when they return back to the Overworld. Rewards from quests & treasure trails will be considered in transfering to and from the Overworld as well. Developing different processes to transfer items to and from; considering a mail system probably. idkyet
